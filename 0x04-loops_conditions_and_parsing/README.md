Bash Scripting: Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

This README provides a brief overview of loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting.
Loops

Loops in Bash allow executing a block of code repeatedly based on a condition.

    for loop: Executes a block of code for each item in a sequence.
    while loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    until loop: Repeats a block of code until a specified condition becomes true.

Conditions

Conditional statements control the flow of execution based on specified conditions.

    if statement: Executes code based on whether a condition is true or false.
    case statement: Performs different actions based on different values.

Parsing

Parsing involves extracting and interpreting data from strings or files.

    cut command: Extracts specific parts of a string or file based on delimiters.
    String manipulation: Uses commands like awk, sed, and grep for string parsing.
